# log-alert-pipeline
## Purpose
This Python project is designed to enhance your security monitoring capabilities. It analyzes JSON logs generated by Wazuh and Suricata, intelligently extracts key information, filters for suspicious activity, and then sends timely email alerts to administrators, ensuring you're always informed about potential threats.

## Project Structure
The log-alert-pipeline project is organized into a clear and logical structure to promote maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of the main directories and files:

```

│   ├── main.py                      # The main execution file; orchestrates the flow of the application.
│   ├── log_parser.py                # Responsible for parsing Wazuh/Suricata JSON logs and extracting critical fields.
│   ├── alert_analyzer.py            # Contains the core logic for filtering and identifying suspicious activities.
│   ├── email_notifier.py            # Handles the sending of email alerts to specified recipients.
│   └── utils.py                     # Utility functions, such as date/time handling and logging configurations.
├── config/
